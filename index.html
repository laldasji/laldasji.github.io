        Hello,
        Today is 15th September 2022, and you are Akshita Vaishnav of the future, (2023, 21 years old). I don't think you'd remember this now, so let me remind you. The very next day I'm going to tell you that I've started planning your birthday gift already. Guess what, this sentence has been written on 16/09/2022 and I've been rebuked for this already 😂.
        <br>
        <br>
        But as you know, that's not going to stop me.
        So here you go with the rest of the letter.
        <br>
        <br>
        Also, I was just wondering how to send you this because I'm worried that a year of writing would just make the letter so big that it would exceed the maximum allowed size for an email.
        <br>
        <br>
        But anyway, I digress.
        I wanted to know that I love you. Always have, always will. Thanks a lot for my birthday celebration. I LOVED it, a fucking lot. Bass wo thoda muh mein dard tha toh hehehe khana achhe se nhi kha paya. But APART FROM THAT IT WAS A BLAST. I wanted to be in a place with you where we both were at peace. AND I HAD IT ALL ALONG. Thank you for making my special day special with you. It was WAY WAY WAY better than it would've been had you not been there. I must say it was better than my 19th and definitely the best birthday I ever had. You are definitely the sweetest piece of ass I've ever had in my life 💋 (given you're also the ONLY piece of ass I've ever had in my life.
        <br>
        <br>
        I just realised I haven't been putting in as much effort as I should've, and I can do nothing but think of how terrible I've been over the past several months. Abhi se kuchh time pehle hi I would've done so much for you, lekin ab it's like those thoughts don't even come to my mind. I'm really ashamed of myself, and I wish to get back to the way I was with you, AND better. I can not make up for the time that has been lost, but I surely want to give you the best experiences, again. I love you baby. Always have, always will.
        <br>
        <br>
        On 14th March, the day before my father's birthday, I visited your home for the third time. I hope you remember it (This was the day I came to meet you immediately after my midterm exam was over). I had never had so much fun with you till this date. I had never experienced so much joy, love and happiness with you as I did on that day. I guess I've already told you about it multiple times but trust me when I say that it canNOT be overstressed. For the past 4 days all I've been thinking about is the instance when you locked eyes with me while you'd taken nearly all of it in your mouth. I guess this isn't supposed to be in a romantic OR a happy birthday letter but whatever tum puchhogi hi iske baare mein now that I've mentioned this, so there you go pehle hi bata diya.
        <br>

        # The letter is growing slower than I had anticipated … hmm … kuchh karna padega. Last time toh tumne azadpur aane se pehle hi padh liya tha iss baar toh itna karu atleast ki samaypur tak bhi na padh pao.
        <br>
        <br>
        I had a really good time with you at the zoo, bhale hi zoo bhot bekar tha 😂. Anyway, I really had a great time, though you teased me a lot (and so did I). Also, tum jab tank mein thi toh baar baar apni poonch se Pani kyu maar rahi thi Han? Man geela ho jata toh?
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm sorry baby, main tumhe Jaan ke nahi marta itni zor se, Mera aaram se hota h. I never knew ki tumhe sahi mein bhi lagti h and you did always act. I'm really sorry 🥺🤗. Ab se bhot aaram se maarunga. Also, wo hauz khas pe Maine jab tumhe line change tak accompany Kiya, toh tum kyu wapas aane lagi mere sath han? Also, agar aayi toh aayi, why didn't you come all the way just because mummy ne call kar dia, tum toh aa hi sakti thi nevertheless, tumhe thodi roka tha. Lekin hehe hum toh kahin ghume bhi nahi, sirf Rajiv chowk pe khaya aur done. But STILL, even though nahi Gaye kahin, it was a LOT OF FUN, just being around you, having fun. Muje bhot bhot bhot maza aaya even though hum kahin ghoome nhi 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗. Ice cream Tod diya lekin tumne, gndi 😒.
        <br>
        <br>
        Damn, I miss you a lot. Kal baat nahi hui tumse because of your lackadaisical attitude towards the competition, aur aaj bhi nahi ho paa rahi because tum college chali gyi. Dumbass. But koi nhi, ghar aa ke we'll talk.
        Hehehehe the competition went well, especially the “sorry sir” part 😂😂😂😂😂.
        …..it didn't age well…..
        Aur bhensi, ek baat suno, ye kya hai tumhara, perfect ghode ka muh and then bullshit body? Just as a memory, here it is

        Exams chal rahe hain abhi tumhare, and even though I want to talk to you so much and I want you to stay and talk to me, I will not, kyunki tumhe padhai karni hai and I don't want to get in the way of your studying.

        Tum toh driving seekhne wali thi inn chhuttiyo mein, kya hua uska 😂😂😂😂.
        I hope by the time you're reading this message, heavy driver ban chuki hogi hehehe.
        Aur ek cheez bolunga bura na manna, honey bhaiya ne bola tha na ki tum gaadi thok dogi, iss rate se chalta raha toh humare byah tak toh zaroor thok hi dogi huehuehue.
        Everyday I fear losing you, especially with the situation I'm in, the disdain in your behaviour sometimes becomes clear, but I don't want to pay too much attention to that, because I'd rather keep my mind in oblivion than to stress it so much. Every day I feel like we're straying further, but then I also have hope, ki one day, when this shitstorm is over, we'll be reunited once again. A big house in the suburbs, a family of 5, husband & wife, 2 sons and a daughter, all eating breakfast on a happy morning while I take out the trash and ready the kids and you prepare breakfast for us all.
        <br>

        Yaar hyderabad chali gyi tum abhi hi, kya hai yaar. Ek toh waise hi itna kam milte hain, usmein bhi tum chli gyi, but I really hope you have a lot of fun wahan.
        Ah yes, the bahubali statue and your photo next to the ghoda where it looks like you're trying to bring the statue down on yourself to commit suicide, but ok
        Hehe guess what, you did, so yeah hehe

        <br>
        A lot of planning going on for our 1st August, hehehe, tumhe toh yaad bhi nhi hoga I'm sure.
        …this, too, did not age well, hence deleted a lot of content……
        Nevermind, less than two months for your birthday, I've been saving up quite a lot (of everything, iykwim, hehehe). I feel weird talking to you about anything sex related…idk why, even this joke made me feel weird. Nothing ages well, I don't know kya hoga yaar aise, bass ye ek mahina achhe se chala jaye. I'll pray to the gods above ki sab sahi ho jaye, because this year has not been good on us as a couple.

            ...Ek baar ki baat hai, ek jungle mein ek tiger rehta tha. Wo tiger bhot achha shikaar karta tha aur iss kaaran se harr roz bhot achha khana khaata tha. Kabhi deer kha liya, kabhi buffalo kha liya, kabhi kabhi toh hathi hi kha liya!<br>
            <br>
            Ek din usko ek sher ne challenge kiya ki aao, mere se achha shikar karo toh main maanu. Tiger jo tha, he was very adamant, toh usne uski chunauti maan li, aur dono phir chale gaye shikar karne. Sher toh ek deer maar ke le aaya aur bhot khush, lekin phir tiger ek bull le aaya, toh sher ko gussa aa gaya, usne socha,"isne MERE se achhe se shikar kaise kar liya?!", aur phir usne tiger pe hamla kar diya. Lekin tiger toh bhot strong tha, toh usne phir usko ek baar mein hara diya, bhot ganda zakhmi kar diya, aur dono ka shikaar khud hi kha gaya, aur sher bhookha reh gaya.<br>
            <br>
            Apni iss jeet se harshollaas se bhar, tiger ne ye proclaim kar--you know what, main normally hi likh leta hu hindi mein nahi likha jaa raha. Han so after his victory against the lion, he proclaimed himself to be the best hunter in the entire jungle and also claimed that no other animal was as ferocious or as strong as he was. Since every animal was already afraid of the tiger, and now that he had also defeated the lion, no one stood to challenge his claim. Henceforth, he became the new king of the jungle.<br>
            <br>
            Slowly, as time passed, the tiger grew more obnoxious, because of his increasing arrogance and pompous attitude. One day, he proposed to all the animals of the jungle to ration themselves out to him, every once a week, and in return he would not hunt them. Afraid of the tiger, everyone agreed, and sent one animal as a sacrifice to the tiger every week.<br>
            <br>
            Steadily, the tiger ate and ate and ate, without needing to hunt; he ate badgers and antelopes, and deers and oxen, and zebra and elephants, and sometimes even giraffes!<br>
            <br>
            Then one day, he became furious. The animal that was sent to him was a mouse. A mouse! For the King of the Jungle! This was preposterous! He at once called in his minister, the fox, and sent him to the main jungle to address all the beings.<br>
            After some time, the fox reappeared in front of the tiger, badly wounded, gasping for breath, as if he had just escaped death. In the few breaths he had left, he said to the tiger,"a lion has come forward and proclaims himself to be the king of this jungle, and has scared everyone into submission. When I went to the thicket carrying the name of your majesty, he attacked me with his unusually sharp claws and asked me to show this as a message to you, and challenged your authority over the jungle." Angered beyond what he could control, he set off at once to the thicket.<br>
            <br>
            There he saw the same lion he had once defeated. The tiger smirked, and cried,"I mauled you once, I'll do it again". The lion immediately attacked the tiger and their battle began. They exchanged blows for a few seconds, before the tiger realised that he had started to exhaust. Months of not hunting had left his muscles weak, and even though he did not realise it, he had grown fat, which was clear to the other animals, but for some reason, not to himself. He got very tired within minutes. Seizing the opportunity, the lion attacked his neck, the tiger seeing this, jumped as high as he could. But he could not jump high enough. The lion sunk his fangs into the tiger's neck, and the tiger bled to his death.<br><br>
            Moral of the story: Don't be a dummy and read the story mindlessly and THEN look for a moral, read the story again and figure it out for yourself. <sub>(hint: crush your enemies completely; the moment you stop, the moment you lose)</sub>

            ...Once upon a time, there was a wrestling master who was versed with 360 feints and holds. He took a special liking to one of his pupils and taught him 359 out of them over a period of time. For some reason, he never got to the final one. As time passed, the young man become so proficient in the art that he bested everyone who faced him in the ring. He became so proud of his prowess that he declared before the king that he could easily whip his master, had it not been for the respect of his age. The king therefore ordered a match between the master and the pupil, seeing his irreverence.<br>
            <br>
            immediately after the match started, the young pupil charged at his master, only to find himself in the 360th hold. The master seized his pupil, lifted him up and crashed him into the ground. When the king asked the master how he was able to overcome such a strong opponent, he quoted a master archer,"No one has learned archery from me, who has in the end used me as a target".

            <br>
            Hello,
            Today is 15<sup>th</sup> September 2022, and you are Akshita Vaishnav of the future, (2023, 21 years old). I don't think you'd remember this now, so let me remind you. The very next day I'm going to tell you that I've started planning your birthday gift already. Guess what, this sentence has been written on 16/09/2022 and I've been rebuked for this already 😂.
            <br>
            <br>
            But as you know, that's not going to stop me.
            So here you go with the rest of the letter.
            <br>
            <br>
            Also, I was just wondering how to send you this because I'm worried that a year of writing would just make the letter so big that it would exceed the maximum allowed size for an email.
            <br>
            <br>
            But anyway, I digress.
        I wanted to know that I love you. Always have, always will. Thanks a lot for being a part of my birthday celebration. I LOVED it, a fucking lot. Bass wo thoda muh mein dard tha toh hehehe khana achhe se nhi kha paya. But <b>apart from that it was a blast</b>. I wanted to be in a place with you where all of us were at peace. <b>And I had it all along.</b> Thank you for making my special day special with you. It was <b>way way way</b> better than it would've been had you not been there. I must say it was better than my 19<sup>th</sup> and definitely the best birthday I ever had. You are definitely the sweetest person I've ever had in my life.
            <br>
            <br>
            I just realised I haven't been putting in as much effort as I should've, and I can do nothing but think of how terrible I've been over the past several months. I'm really ashamed of myself, and I wish to get back to the way I was with you, and better. I can not make up for the time that has been lost, but I surely want to give you the best experiences, again. I love you baby. Always have, always will.
            <br>
            <br>
            On 14<sup>th</sup> March, the day before my father's birthday, I visited you for the third time. I hope you remember it (This was the day I came to meet you immediately after my midterm exam was over). I had never had so much fun with you till this date. I had never experienced so much joy, love, oneness and happiness with you as I did on that day. I guess I've already told you about it multiple times but trust me when I say that it canNOT be overstressed. I felt a very unique connection with you that day, I can't even begin to explain how good I felt around you.

            # The letter is growing slower than I had anticipated … hmm … kuchh karna padega. Last time toh tumne azadpur aane se pehle hi padh liya tha iss baar toh itna karu atleast ki samaypur tak bhi na padh pao. #
            <br>
            <br>
            I had a really good time with you at the zoo, bhale hi zoo bhot bekar tha 😂. Anyway, I really had a great time, though you teased me a lot (and so did I). Also, tum jab tank mein thi toh baar baar apni poonch se Pani kyu maar rahi thi Han? Main geela ho jata toh? Agli baar lekin zoo nhi jayenge bhai, it was a waste of time. Bandar dekhna hota toh main college na chale jaata? Deer dekhne hote toh main deer park na chale jaata? Hathi dekhne hote toh main mirror na dekh leta? Hippo dekhna hota toh main tumhe video call na kar leta?
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm sorry baby, main tumhe Jaan ke nahi marta itni zor se, Mera aaram se hota h. I never knew ki tumhe sahi mein bhi lagti h and you did always act. I'm really sorry 🥺 🤗. Ab se bhot aaram se maarunga. Also, wo hauz khas pe Maine jab tumhe line change tak accompany Kiya, toh tum kyu wapas aane lagi mere sath han? Also, agar aayi toh aayi, why didn't you come all the way just because mummy ne call kar dia, tum toh aa hi sakti thi nevertheless, tumhe thodi roka tha. Lekin hehe hum toh kahin ghume bhi nahi, sirf Rajiv chowk pe khaya aur done. But STILL, even though nahi Gaye kahin, it was a LOT OF FUN, just being around you, having fun. Muje bhot bhot bhot maza aaya even though hum kahin ghoome nhi 🤗 🤗 🤗 🤗 🤗. Ice cream tod diya lekin tumne, gndi 😒.
            <br>
            <br>
            Damn, I miss you a lot. Kal baat nahi hui tumse because of your lackadaisical attitude towards the competition, aur aaj bhi nahi ho paa rahi because tum college chali gyi. Dumbass. But koi nhi, ghar aa ke we'll talk.
            Hehehehe the competition went well, especially the “sorry sir” part 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂.
            …..it didn't age well…..
            Aur bhensi, ek baat suno, ye kya hai tumhara, perfect ghode ka muh and then bullshit body? Just as a memory, here it is

            I hope by the time you're reading this message, heavy driver ban chuki hogi hehehe.
            Aur ek cheez bolunga bura na manna, honey bhaiya ne bola tha na ki tum gaadi thok dogi, iss rate se chalta raha toh humare byah tak toh zaroor thok hi dogi huehuehue.
            Everyday I fear losing you, especially with the situation I'm in, the disdain in your behaviour sometimes becomes clear, but I don't want to pay too much attention to that, because I'd rather keep my mind in oblivion than to stress it so much. Every day I feel like we're straying further, but then I also have hope, ki one day, when this shitstorm is over, we'll be reunited once again. A big house in the suburbs, a family of 5, husband & wife, 2 sons and a daughter, all eating breakfast on a happy morning while I take out the trash and ready the kids and you prepare breakfast for us all.

            Yaar hyderabad chali gyi tum abhi hi, kya hai yaar. Ek toh waise hi itna kam milte hain, usmein bhi tum chli gyi, but I really hope you have a lot of fun wahan.
            Ah yes, the bahubali statue and your photo next to the ghoda where it looks like you're trying to bring the statue down on yourself to commit suicide, but ok
            Hehe guess what, you did, so yeah hehe
            <br>
            <br>
            A lot of planning going on for our 1st August, hehehe, tumhe toh yaad bhi nhi hoga I'm sure.
            …this, too, did not age well, hence deleted a lot of content……
            Nevermind, less than two months for your birthday, I've been saving up quite a lot (of everything, iykwim, hehehe). I feel weird talking to you about anything sex related…idk why, even this joke made me feel weird. Nothing ages well, I don't know kya hoga yaar aise, bass ye ek mahina achhe se chala jaye. I'll pray to the gods above ki sab sahi ho jaye, because this year has not been good on us as a couple.
            <br>
            <br>
            I miss you so much everyday my sweetheart. It pains me to see ki tumhara mindset Aisa ho gya hai apni body ko le kar. Aise mat socha Karo yaar baby dekho, I love you bhot hi zyada, also you're <b>Not</b> unattractive. If you want to improve, sure, there IS room for improvement but that does not mean k Han you're unattractive 🤦‍♂️. Kya bancho aadmi ho yaar tum, tumhe ye sab samjhana pad Raha hai.

            Ek kahani sunata hu main tumhe… and oh btw, abhi se pehle wali cheezein were a reminiscence of the past year, live, ab ek mahine mein kya hi reminisce karne wala hoga jo tumhe yaad nhi hoga hehehe... Anyway! Back to the story....
            </p>
            <p class="blurry" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';font-size: 30px;text-indent: 80px;font-style: italic;">
                ...Ek baar ki baat hai, ek jungle mein ek tiger rehta tha. Wo tiger bhot achha shikaar karta tha aur iss kaaran se harr roz bhot achha khana khaata tha. Kabhi deer kha liya, kabhi buffalo kha liya, kabhi kabhi toh hathi hi kha liya!<br>
                <br>
                Ek din usko ek sher ne challenge kiya ki aao, mere se achha shikar karo toh main maanu. Tiger jo tha, he was very adamant, toh usne uski chunauti maan li, aur dono phir chale gaye shikar karne. Sher toh ek deer maar ke le aaya aur bhot khush, lekin phir tiger ek bull le aaya, toh sher ko gussa aa gaya, usne socha,"isne MERE se achhe se shikar kaise kar liya?!", aur phir usne tiger pe hamla kar diya. Lekin tiger toh bhot strong tha, toh usne phir usko ek baar mein hara diya, bhot ganda zakhmi kar diya, aur dono ka shikaar khud hi kha gaya, aur sher bhookha reh gaya.<br>
                <br>
                Apni iss jeet se harshollaas se bhar, tiger ne ye proclaim kar--you know what, main normally hi likh leta hu hindi mein nahi likha jaa raha. Han so after his victory against the lion, he proclaimed himself to be the best hunter in the entire jungle and also claimed that no other animal was as ferocious or as strong as he was. Since every animal was already afraid of the tiger, and now that he had also defeated the lion, no one stood to challenge his claim. Henceforth, he became the new king of the jungle.<br>
                <br>
                Slowly, as time passed, the tiger grew more obnoxious, because of his increasing arrogance and pompous attitude. One day, he proposed to all the animals of the jungle to ration themselves out to him, every once a week, and in return he would not hunt them. Afraid of the tiger, everyone agreed, and sent one animal as a sacrifice to the tiger every week.<br>
                <br>
                Steadily, the tiger ate and ate and ate, without needing to hunt; he ate badgers and antelopes, and deers and oxen, and zebra and elephants, and sometimes even giraffes!<br>
                <br>
                Then one day, he became furious. The animal that was sent to him was a mouse. A mouse! For the King of the Jungle! This was preposterous! He at once called in his minister, the fox, and sent him to the main jungle to address all the beings.<br>
                After some time, the fox reappeared in front of the tiger, badly wounded, gasping for breath, as if he had just escaped death. In the few breaths he had left, he said to the tiger,"a lion has come forward and proclaims himself to be the king of this jungle, and has scared everyone into submission. When I went to the thicket carrying the name of your majesty, he attacked me with his unusually sharp claws and asked me to show this as a message to you, and challenged your authority over the jungle." Angered beyond what he could control, he set off at once to the thicket.<br>
                <br>
                There he saw the same lion he had once defeated. The tiger smirked, and cried,"I mauled you once, I'll do it again". The lion immediately attacked the tiger and their battle began. They exchanged blows for a few seconds, before the tiger realised that he had started to exhaust. Months of not hunting had left his muscles weak, and even though he did not realise it, he had grown fat, which was clear to the other animals, but for some reason, not to himself. He got very tired within minutes. Seizing the opportunity, the lion attacked his neck, the tiger seeing this, jumped as high as he could. But he could not jump high enough. The lion sunk his fangs into the tiger's neck, and the tiger bled to his death.<br><br>
                Moral of the story: Don't be a dummy and read the story mindlessly and THEN look for a moral, read the story again and figure it out for yourself. <sub>(hint: crush your enemies completely; the moment you stop, the moment you lose)</sub>

                ...Once upon a time, there was a wrestling master who was versed with 360 feints and holds. He took a special liking to one of his pupils and taught him 359 out of them over a period of time. For some reason, he never got to the final one. As time passed, the young man become so proficient in the art that he bested everyone who faced him in the ring. He became so proud of his prowess that he declared before the king that he could easily whip his master, had it not been for the respect of his age. The king therefore ordered a match between the master and the pupil, seeing his irreverence.<br>
                <br>
                immediately after the match started, the young pupil charged at his master, only to find himself in the 360<sup>th</sup> hold. The master seized his pupil, lifted him up and crashed him into the ground. When the king asked the master how he was able to overcome such a strong opponent, he quoted a master archer,"No one has learned archery from me, who has in the end not used me as a target".

                Yaar, itne time se baat nhi ho rahi, jabse mera college phirse shuru hua hai 5<sup>th</sup> sem ke liye tab se pehle se hi, ya toh tum busy ya main busy, tum busy nhi toh main hu, agar main nhi toh tum ho, tum toh khaer kuchh zyada hi ho lagatar kayi din baat nhi hui ab toh dhang se....*sigh*, <b>Anyway</b>, only 37 days left for your birthday huehuehue, aur idhar toh mere savings bhi achhe se nhi hue yaar.... abhi toh 1,200 hue hain save.... yaar mujhe nhi lagta BBQ nation mein kar payenge lunch... <br>
                <br>
                maine abhi dekha, we CAN actually have lunch in BBQ nation, I just need to save a little more hehe, but I'll still ask you abhi hi wait puchh hi leta hu.<br>
                Puchh liya, ab tumhare respose ka wait kar raha hu main... let's see, let's see.<br><br>
                I'm just writing jargon at this point, I don't know if it's even relevant or makes sense, but yeah, I'm just typing stuff.<br>
                I want you to know that <b>I Love You Very Much</b>, remember this.<br>
                Tumhe pata hai tumne bhot achha kiya hai sab kuchh
                <br>
                Oh wait right, main batana bhul gya, ki agar ab letter dekh ke you've made up your mind to NOT go to BBQ nation, it's pointless, kyunki agar tumne han bola hoga uss time toh maine already reserve kar li hongi seats hehehe.<br>
                Don't get angry on me regarding the reservations, or I'll punch your teeth inside. Again, this message is assuming that you agreed to having lunch at BBQ Nation.<br>
                <br>
                Yaar baat kar lo na baby I miss you so much, baat hi nahi kar rahi tum badtameez ladki =_=#
                <br><br>
                Hehe Background ki photo mein tum itni patli lag rahi ho aur main itna mota, but I'm sure by the time you read this letter, things would be <i>quite</i> different, to say the least.<br>
                <br>
                Hanji toh na mere parents jaane wale hain gaon, plan toh ban raha hai at least. Agar aisa hua toh I can invite you over hehehe... but again, kab jayenge kab nahi wo pata nhi, agar tum mere ghar aaogi phir toh bhai I can do SO fucking much, cook you pasta, order bahar ka khana, watch a movie together, and what not! I wish daddy aur mummy chale jayein tumhare birthday ke time. But for that mujhe achha bachha ban ke rehna hoga, eh koi nhi. <b>Agar tum</b> mere ghar aa rahi ho iss baar toh bhaiya kaa hi batayein maje hi maje aane wale hain. (HEHE I'm covering all possibilities of celebration of your birthday huehue).<br>
                <br>
                Anyway, here are a few (and ONLY a few, sach mein sirf 3 hi hain) things that I remember very clearly, and how you will be remembered in my brain forever, sabse zyada, inn instances mein. Pichhle ek saal ke hain sirf ye, and again, <b>NOT</b> in chronological order.

                <b>PS: iss letter ke liye maine itni baar tumhari photo dekh li ki you now look ugly to me.<br>
                Bye.</b><br>
                No but jokes apart, tum kaafi sahi ho yaar, kaafi pyari, kaafi caring, kaafi loving. I'll keep you forever. I love you a lot. You're my best friend. muahhh 💋. The past one year has had its ups and downs, but I'm sure by the time you'll be reading this letter, almost all of it would be sorted completely. I have complete faith in God that he'll fix everything for the best. May the next years AND today go well, so that we have an amazing future ahead of us. You are a great person, harr tarah se, and I'm sure you'll be that way forever, the best person you are. I'll try to come up to your level...that's all I can say. Ab tum bologi ki,"you are.... you don't need to....washing powder nirma...", <b>shut up, just shut up</b>. Yes, good, I love you baby, jaldi milo mere se, so that I can hug you, kiss you, tease you, beat you up (just a little) and do naughty things to you. I miss you a lot <i>*hugs you*</i>. I hope tum birthday ke din mere se mil pao (bass ye cheez jinx na ho, warna toh saara kuchh bekar ho jayega...). Yaar I love you so much, I want to be a part of your life for ever, and I want everything to go well, much better than things have been going for the past few months, a year, in fact. I miss how we were before I left the flat, itna aaram se rehte thhe humesha, shanti se, ladaiyan hoti thi lekin pyar bhi bhot hi zyada tha. You know what, and I haven't said it to your face for the fear of sounding weird, but things haven't been going so well since we've lost 'intimacy', if you know what I'm getting at. Han ho sakta hai meri hi taraf se ho, and I might even argue ki han 60/40 hoga, but yes tabse hai. Nevermind, I want you to have a beautiful 21st, and I don't just mean the birthday, I mean from 15<sup>th</sup> September 2023 to 14<sup>th</sup> September 2024. I pray to God ki no matter what happens to the relationship, kabhi bhi, humesha hi, tum humesha hi khush raho aur kabhi tumhe kisi bhi cheez ki dikkat na ho <br>
                <br>
                Hehe the POST script sounds more like a letter than the main letter<br>
                <br>
                Yaar tum itni sahi ho, pata nahi kaise, par jaise bhi ho mujhe kya mujhe toh fayda hi hai na, tumhare pyaar, maar, tang karna, sab kuchh ka hehehe, I'm very lucky to have you in my life my sweet little sitaphal ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️. Matter of fact, everyone is lucky to have you in their lives, some more, some less, but I must say I'm on the more side huehue. Mallika is definitely on the unlucky side hehe. Ab bhi main tumhara wo yaad karta hu,<i>Tu jahan rahegi wahan toh porn banne hi lag jayegi"</i>, mere mann mein do cheezein aati hain, ek hai 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 aur dusra hai "hawwwww", but DAMN was it good. Aaj kal, however (about a month before your birthday), I feel like you censor yourself when around me...and it's hard for me to, well, be normal when that happens...<br>
                Now yes I contain my emotions and don't talk about it much because I'm a man and I expect myself to have some emotional fortitude, but it does bother me...<br>
                <b>Anyway</b>, Aaj toh tumhara birthday hai ye sab baatein chhodo brother, mere saath aao, khao piyo (hehe) and mazze karo.<br>

                <br>
                Hanji toh ye rahi aaj ki itenerary (more like user decided itenerary). Also remember, iska vlog banega toh uske liye ready rehna and act and pose well. Battery 100% karke launga main, ho saka toh powerbank bhi huehuehue (bhot kam likely hai lekin, kyunki daddy ka hai na powerbank).
                <br>
                I mean, post scripts are supposed to be short but ok ye bhi thike hehe 😅 😅 😅 😅<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Chalo that's finally it from my side (in the letter, that is, and only in the letter). Abhi ho sakta hai main tumse milne aa raha hounga ya tumhare side mein hounga, kyunki ye letter hai toh bhot bada hehe. Khaer kya fayda, kitna hi bada letter ho tum toh jaldi hi khatam kar logi, what's the point, <i>*sigh*</i>. Console karne ke liye ye sab na bolna ki nhi nhi maine nhi padha blah blah blah, just read it and meet me.<br>
                <br>
                <b>This was what all I had planned, lekin kuchh bhi nhi ho paya...<i>*sigh*</i>...</b><br>

            <p class="blurry" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-style: bold;font-size: xx-large;">Anyway, a year of hardwork, wasted. Things are going to get pretty serious from now on, and they're going to happen exactly as I want them to be. What happened was a person abusing their power, and I'm going to ensure to remain on top if it, forever. <br>
            Certain things and intentions can not be stated, for reasons that we live in a data controlled world, which can be accessed easily by people who control or audit it, however, implicit understanding of the message is supposed.
            Security measures have been taken to the effect of same, as you would now know and understand.<br>
            I very much wanted to edit the letter to accomodate to the current mood, but I believe that the current situation should not affect the work of the past. I don't think you feel good at all, and neither do I, and this celebration won't so much be a celebration as an ostensible gathering for your family.<br>
            By the time you'd be reading this message, I'm sure you'd have developed the skill of email writing, or atleast 25% of it.<br>
            <br>
            It's two days after the incident, and I've planned to send you this letter through the mail, and not launch it on the website, for fear of the same. Daddy is planning to cease my education and sell this house, and he might even go through with it, I don't know... I'm not comparing hardships, I'm just telling you what's happening in my life.<br>
            <br>
            Right when things were clearly getting better, ye ho gya, jab pichhle saal jo bhi hua tha wo sab sahi ho raha tha, ye ho gya... Isse ghatiya kya hi timing hogi yaar...<br>
            <br><br>
            Hehe, today is the first of September, and I've realised that you're learning how to write emails, you're getting VERY good at writing emails I must say. I've somewhat pulled out of the "sad" phase and I've started to do my duties again, walk karna, padhai karna, sahi khana, overeat na karna. Today has been a good day... I hope you too recovered on this front by this time. Tumhare mails se lag toh nhi raha but I can only hope, so yeah...<br>
            Main gaon jaane wala hu in 5 days, I wish we could meet before that, but God knows we can't, It's actually physically impossible... This is LITERALLY the plot of baghban, as from the perspective of Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini hehe (trying to lighten the mood, which I don't think would be very light, seeing the circumstances...). I can only HOPE that we meet on your birthday... I'll pray to God, or not. The last time I did, Himanshu wala happened. You know what, I'll still pray to God. One mishap should not avert me from God.<br>
            <br>
            Aa gaya main gaon se, waise gaon ka description dete hue letter toh likha hai hi maine, but you know what, now I have a dream for the both of us. A home in the country. Ek ghar tumhare gaon ke paas, aur ek mere gaon ke paas. I'll build a house for us apne gaon mien, jahan hum rahenge once a year for a fortnight at least. Wahan we'll work hard, do most of the stuff together, and work hard and live a humble life. Khud khana banana, ghar ke liye cheezein ikattha karna, samaan laana, sab khud. I loved my stay gaon mein. And even though I stayed there only for four days, I'll reminisce every day of my visit, every hour of my visit until I visit again. My visit to my gaon gave me hope for us, hope for a better future out of this hellhole called a metropolitan area, where everyone has an ulterior motive and you have to keep your brains working 24/7 in ways to fool someone, just to survive.<br>
            <br>
            I wish you have a very happy birthday, and remember, I'll NEVER rat you out.<br>
            And I'll end this letter with a single thought, I'm going to exact everything that what everyone owes to me.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; - at least this is what I had written earlier, my visit to my hometown has filled the spiritual void in my brain. I'd rather forgive and forget, and stay hopeful that MY future will be like the present in my village, a world that is fearful of God. I let vengeance rule my heart, when it should've been God, forgiveness, and hard work, which shall now and forever hold my reigns. I'm sorry you had to see me in this phase.<br>
            <br>
            I love you a lot, and I'll always be with you<br>
            *hugs you*<br>
            *kisses you*<br>
            *waise karna toh bhot kuchh hai, bass likh nhi sakta hehe*<br>
            Happy Birthday,<br>
            Ghaint Pishori Lal (hehehe)<br>
